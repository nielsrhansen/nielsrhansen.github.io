## R programming 

* .large[An R program consists of a hierarchy of function calls.] 

  - When the program is executed, function calls are evaluated and replaced by their return values. 

--

* .large[R functions are fundamental.] 
  - They don't do anything before they are called and the call is evaluated. 
  - An R function takes a number of *arguments*, and when a function call is evaluated it computes a *return value*.
  - All the R code that you have written and executed so far has effectively consisted of calling R
functions.

--

.large[It's time to write your own function.]


---

## Writing an R function 

A function that counts the number of zeroes in a vector.


```r
countZero &lt;- function(x) {
  nr &lt;- 0
  for(i in seq_along(x)) ## 1:length(x) wrong if length(x) is 0
    nr &lt;- nr + (x[i] == 0)  ## logical coerced to numeric
  nr
}
```

--

The implementation works in most programming languages:

- Initialize a counter to be 0.
- Loop through the elements of the vector.
- Increment the counter whenever an element equals zero.
- Return the value of the counter.

---

## Testing an R function


```r
tests &lt;- list(
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 25),
  c(0, 1, 10, 0, 5, -4, 2.5),
  c(2, 1, 10),
  c())  ## Extreme case
## map_dbl and other map functions in package purrr
map_dbl(tests, countZero)   
```

```
[1] 4 2 0 0
```

We can manually inspect that the results are correct,

--

or we can do it programmatically.


```r
all(map_dbl(tests, countZero) == c(4, 2, 0, 0))
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

---

## Writing an R function, version 2


```r
countZero2 &lt;- function(x)
  sum(x == 0)
```

--

Testing:


```r
map_dbl(tests, countZero2)
```

```
[1] 4 2 0 0
```

--


```r
all(map_dbl(tests, countZero) == map_dbl(tests, countZero2))
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

---

## Vectorized R code


```r
countZero2
```

```
function(x)
  sum(x == 0)
```

* The expression `x == 0` tests each entry of the vector `x` for being equal to 0 and returns a vector of logicals.

--

* The `sum` function computes and returns the sum of all elements in a vector. Logicals are coerced to integers. 

--

* The vectorized computations are performed by compiled code. They are faster to evaluate than R code.  

--

* Writing vectorized code requires a larger knowledge of R functions.

---

## Where are all the functions located?

--

When you define a new R function in the console, it will live in your workspace technically known as 
the **Global Environment**.

--

Functions defined in packages reside in their corresponding **namespace**. Here they live protected from 
your functions and functions in other packages.

--

Each package has a set of **exported** functions. When the package is loaded, the exported 
functions become available to you. 

--

Loading a package can **mask** exported functions from other packages. This only affects how 
easy it is for you to use the functions. 

---

## Namespaces

&lt;img src="namespace.png" width="650" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

To make sure to use `sd` from package stats write `stats::sd`. To use functions not exported 
from package stats write `stats:::.Diag` (not recommended). 

---

## S3 in two minutes

* S3 classes are standard data structures (typically lists) with *class labels*.

--

* It is an informal system. There are no checks of object content.

--

* One defines a *generic* function via `UseMethod`.

--

* Then *methods* for specific classes are implemented as standard R functions 
with the naming convention `f.classname` for a method for class `classname` of the function `f`. 

--

* Widely used to write methods for the generic functions `print`, `plot` and `summary`. 

---

## An example 


```r
whichZero &lt;- function(x)
  structure(
    list(x = x, zeroes = which(x == 0)), 
    class = "knowZeroes"     ## This defines the class label
    )
```

--


```r
print.knowZeroes &lt;- function(x, ...) ## Method for class 'knowZeroes' objects
  cat(x$x)
```

--


```r
x &lt;- whichZero(c(4, 2, 0, 0)); x
```

```
4 2 0 0
```

--


```r
str(x)
```

```
List of 2
 $ x     : num [1:4] 4 2 0 0
 $ zeroes: int [1:2] 3 4
 - attr(*, "class")= chr "knowZeroes"
```

---

## Counting zeroes for objects that know zeroes 


```r
countZero &lt;- function(x)  ## A generic function
  UseMethod("countZero") 
```

--


```r
countZero.knowZeroes &lt;- function(x)
  length(x$zeroes)
```

--


```r
countZero(x)
```

```
[1] 2
```

---

## Extracting nonzero values


```r
nonZeroes &lt;- function(x)  
  UseMethod("nonZeroes") 
nonZeroes.knowZeroes &lt;- function(x) 
  x$x[-x$zeroes]
```

--


```r
nonZeroes(x)
```

```
[1] 4 2
```


---

## Why bother?

Even if you are never going to write S3 methods, it's useful to know about them.

--

Try `?summary` in the R console. This will give you some information, starting by stating that 

"`summary` is a generic function used to produce ..."

and some specific methods are documented.

--

Soon you will learn about linear models and `lm`. Documentation for the summary methods
for objects of class `lm` are found by `?summary.lm`. 

--

Finally, you understand that some magical behavior of R is actually controlled and explainable by 
the S3 class system.
