# Computational Statistics, <br> R and Functions
### Niels Richard Hansen

---
## Computational Statistics

--
**Optimization**
--

* Continuous model parameters.
* Meta or tuning parameters.
* Combinatorial structures, e.g. models.

--

**Integration**
--

* Mean and variance, `\(E f(X) = \int f(X) \ dP\)`.
* Probabilities, `\(P(X \in A) = \int_{(X \in A)} \ dP\)`.
* Marginalization, Bayesian posteriors.

---
## RStudio 

--
**Projects**
--

* Useful for organizing the assignments.
* Support version control (Git).
* Easy to use.

--

**R packages**
--

* Better structure and organization of documentation (Roxygen).
* More smooth integration with compiled code.
* More things to learn that are not covered in the course.

---
## Prerequisites in R 

Good working knowledge of:

* Data structures (vectors, lists, data frames).
--

* Control structures (loops, if-then-else).
--

* Function calling.
--

* Interactive and script usages (`source`) of R.
--

* You don't need to be an experienced programmer.

---
## Assignments

The 8 assignments covering 4 topics will form the backbone for the course. Many 
lectures and practicals will be build around these assignments.

--

You all need to register (in Absalon) for the presentation of 
one assignment solution. 

--

* Presentations are done in groups of two-three persons. 
* On four Wednesdays there will be presentations with discussion and feedback.
* For the exam you need to prepare four *individual* presentations, one for each topic assignment.


---
## Exam

For each of the four topics you choose one out of two assignments to 
prepare for the exam.

--

* The exam assessment is based on your presentation *on the basis of the 
entire content of the course*.
* Get started immediately and work continuously on the assignments as the
course progresses. 

---
## R programming 

R functions are fundamental. They don't do anything before they are called and the call is evaluated. 
--


An R function takes a number of *arguments*, and when a function call is evaluated it computes a *return value*.

--

An R program consists of a hierarchy of function calls. When the program is executed, function calls are evaluated and 
replaced by their return values. 

--

Implementations of R functions are collected into source files, which can be organized into R packages.

--

An R script (or R Markdown document) is a collection of R function calls, which, when evaluated, 
compute a desired result. 

--

R programming includes activities at many different levels of sophistication and abstraction.

---
## R programming

R programming can be  

* writing R scripts (for data analysis), interactively running scripts and building reports or other output.
--

* writing R functions to ease repetitive tasks (avoid copy-paste), to abstract computations, to improve overview by modularization etc.
--

* developing R packages to ease distribution, to improve usability and documentation, to clarify dependencies etc.

---
## Writing an R function

A function that counts the number of zeroes in a vector.


```r
countZero &lt;- function(x) {
  nr &lt;- 0
  for(i in seq_along(x)) ## 1:length(x) wrong if length(x) is 0
    nr &lt;- nr + (x[i] == 0)  ## logical coerced to numeric
  nr
}
```

--
The implementation works in most programming languages:
--

* Initialize a counter to be 0.
* Loop through the elements of the vector.
* Increment the counter whenever an element equals zero.
* Return the value of the counter.

---
## Testing an R function


```r
tests &lt;- list(
  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 25),
  c(0, 1, 10, 0, 5, -4, 2.5),
  c(2, 1, 10),
  c())  ## Extreme case
sapply(tests, countZero)
```

```
## [1] 4 2 0 0
```

--
We can manually inspect that the results are correct, or we can do it programmatically.


```r
all(sapply(tests, countZero) == c(4, 2, 0, 0))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---
## Writing an R function, version 2


```r
countZero2 &lt;- function(x)
  sum(x == 0)
```

--
Testing:


```r
all(sapply(tests, countZero) == sapply(tests, countZero2))
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

```r
identical(
  sapply(tests, countZero),
  sapply(tests, countZero2)
)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

---
## Results are equal but not identical!?


```r
typeof(sapply(tests, countZero))
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

--

```r
countZero &lt;- function(x) {
* nr &lt;- 0L   ## counter now of type integer! 
  for(i in seq_along(x))  
    nr &lt;- nr + (x[i] == 0)
  nr
}
```

--

```r
typeof(sapply(tests, countZero))
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

---
## Results are now identical


```r
identical(
  sapply(tests, countZero),
  sapply(tests, countZero2)
)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

---
## Vectorized R code


```r
countZero2
```

```
## function(x)
##   sum(x == 0)
```


--
* The expression `x == 0` tests each entry of the vector `x` for being equal to 0 and returns a vector of logicals.
--

* The `sum` function computes and returns the sum of all elements in a vector. Logicals are coerced to integers. 
--

* The vectorized implementation is short but expressive and easy to understand.
--

* The vectorized computations are performed by compiled code. They are faster to evaluate than R code.  
--

* Writing vectorized code requires a larger knowledge of R functions.

---
# Practical Exercise 1

&lt;img src="PracIcon.png" width="500" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
## Functions 

R functions consist of three components.


```r
foo &lt;- function(x) {
  x^2 + x + 1
}
```

* The *body* of the function, which is the code in the function.
--

* The *argument list* that the function takes.
--

* The *enclosing environment* where the function was created.

---
## Functions


```r
body(foo) 
```

```
## {
##     x^2 + x + 1
## }
```

```r
formals(foo)  ## formal argument list
```

```
## $x
```

```r
environment(foo)  ## enclosing environment
```

```
## &lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt;
```

---
## Function evaluation

When functions are called the body is evaluated with formal arguments 
replaced by actual arguments (values).



```r
foo(10)  ## body evaluated with x = 10
```

```
## [1] 111
```

--
The result is the same as: 


```r
{x &lt;- 10;  x^2 + x + 1}
```

```
## [1] 111
```

---
## Function body

The function components can be manipulated like other R components.


```r
body(foo) &lt;- quote({y*x^2 + x + 1})
foo  ## new body
```

```
## function (x) 
## {
##     y * x^2 + x + 1
## }
```

--
The function `quote` prevents R from evaluating the expression 
`{y*x^2 + x + 1}` and simply returns the unevaluated R expression, 
which then replaces the body of the function `foo`.

---
## Function evaluation

What happens when we try to evaluate the new function?

--

```r
foo(10)
```

```
## Error in foo(10): object 'y' not found
```

```r
y &lt;- 2  ## y is in the global environment
foo(10) 
```

```
## [1] 211
```

--
Variables that are not assigned in the body or are in the list of formal 
arguments are searched for in the functions *enclosing environment*.

---
## Changing the enclosing environment

The enclosing environment can be changed, and values can be
assigned to variables in environments.


```r
environment(foo) &lt;- new.env()
assign("y", 1, environment(foo))
foo(10)  ## What is the result and why?
```

```
## [1] 111
```

---
## Changing the argument list

The argument list can be changed as well.


```r
formals(foo) &lt;- alist(x = , y = )
foo(10)  ## What will happen?
```

```
## Error in foo(10): argument "y" is missing, with no default
```

```r
foo(10, 2) ## Better?
```

```
## [1] 211
```

---
## How functions work in principle

* When a function is called, the actual arguments are matched against the *formal 
arguments*.
--

* Expressions in the actual argument list are evaluated in the *calling environment*.
--

* Then the *body* of the function is evaluated.
--

* Variables that are not arguments or defined inside the body are searched for 
in the *enclosing environment*.
--

* The value of the last expression in the body is returned by the function.

--


```r
foo(10, y^2)
```

```
## [1] 411
```

---
## Scoping rules

For a variable we distinguish between the *symbol* (the `y`) and its value (`2`, say). 
The rules for finding the symbol are called *scoping* rules, and R implements *lexical scoping*.

--

Symbols reside in environments, and R searches for a symbol in the environment 
where the function is *defined* and *not* where it is called.

--

In practice, symbols are recursively searched for by starting in the functions *evaluation 
environment*, then its *enclosing enviroment* and so on until the empty environment. 

--

For interactive usage lexical scoping can appear strange. Setting "global variables"
might not always have the "expected effect".

--

The "expectation" is typically a *dynamic scoping* rule, which is difficult to predict
and reason about as a programmer. 

---
## Functions as first-class objects

A function is an R language object that can be treated like other objects. 
It is a so-called *first-class object*. The language can create and 
manipulate functions during execution.

--
This means that functions can be arguments.

```r
head(optim, 6)
```

```
##                                                                 
## 1 function (par, fn, gr = NULL, ..., method = c("Nelder-Mead",  
## 2     "BFGS", "CG", "L-BFGS-B", "SANN", "Brent"), lower = -Inf, 
## 3     upper = Inf, control = list(), hessian = FALSE)           
## 4 {                                                             
## 5     fn1 &lt;- function(par) fn(par, ...)                         
## 6     gr1 &lt;- if (!is.null(gr))
```

---
## Functions as first-class objects

Functions can be return values, like in the *function operator* `Vectorize`.

--

```
##                                                                    
## 1  function (FUN, vectorize.args = arg.names, SIMPLIFY = TRUE,     
## 2      USE.NAMES = TRUE)                                           
## 3  {                                                               
## 4  ...                                                             
## 17     FUNV &lt;- function() {                                        
## 18         args &lt;- lapply(as.list(match.call())[-1L],              
## 19             eval, parent.frame())                               
## 20 ...                                                             
## 24         do.call("mapply", c(FUN = FUN, args[dovec],             
## 25             MoreArgs = list(args[!dovec]), SIMPLIFY = SIMPLIFY, 
## 26             USE.NAMES = USE.NAMES))                             
## 27     }                                                           
## 28     formals(FUNV) &lt;- formals(FUN)                               
## 29     FUNV
```

Chapters 10-12 in AvdR cover functional programming in R, but will not be dealt with
systematically in this course.

---
## Computing on the language

R can extract and compute with its own language constructs. This can be used
for *metaprogramming*; writing programs that write programs.

--

Some concrete examples of *computing on the language* are in plot functions for label 
construction, and in `subset` and `lm` for implementing *non-standard evaluation*,
which circumvents the usual scoping rules. 

--

The formula interface is an example of a *domain 
specific language* implemented in R for model specification that uses various 
techniques for computing on the language. 

--

Chapters 13-15 in AvdR cover these techniques in greater detail, but will not be dealt with
systematically in this course.

---
## Return values

A function can return any kind of R object either explicitly by a `return` statement or 
as the value of the last evaluated expression in the body. 

--

Many functions return basic data structures such as a number, a vector, a matrix or a data frame. Some functions return other functions. 

--

Lists can be given a *class label* (`"integrate"` below). This is part of the S3 object system in R, 
which will be covered next week.

---
## Return values

Multiple return values that don't fit into the basic data structures can be returned as a list.


```r
integrate(sin, 0, 1)
```

```
## 0.4596977 with absolute error &lt; 5.1e-15
```

```r
str(integrate(sin, 0, 1))
```

```
## List of 5
##  $ value       : num 0.46
##  $ abs.error   : num 5.1e-15
##  $ subdivisions: int 1
##  $ message     : chr "OK"
##  $ call        : language integrate(f = sin, lower = 0, upper = 1)
##  - attr(*, "class")= chr "integrate"
